## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version:

* `bootstrap_rmse()` now uses `after_stat(density)` instead of the deprecated dot-dot notation
* `custom_theme` in `autoplot.univariate()` is added to customize the theme

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.4.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of insurancerating.
All packages that I could install passed.
