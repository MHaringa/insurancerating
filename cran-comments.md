## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version:

* `update_glm()` now always returns the correct interval in case the function is used in combination with `smooth_coef()`

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.2.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of insurancerating.
All packages that I could install passed.
