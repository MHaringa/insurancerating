\description{
Fits a generalized additive model (GAM) to continuous risk
factors in one of the following three types of models: the number of reported
claims (claim frequency), the severity of reported claims (claim severity)
or the burning cost (i.e. risk premium or pure premium).
}
\details{
The 'frequency' specification uses a Poisson GAM for fitting the
number of claims. The logarithm of the exposure is included as an offset,
such that the expected number of claims is proportional to the exposure.

The 'severity' specification uses a lognormal GAM for fitting the average
cost of a claim. The average cost of a claim is defined as the ratio of the
claim amount and the number of claims. The number of claims is included as a
weight.

The 'burning' specification uses a lognormal GAM for fitting the pure
premium of a claim. The pure premium is obtained by multiplying the estimated
frequency and the estimated severity of claims. The word burning cost is
used here as equivalent of risk premium and pure premium. Note that the
functionality for fitting a GAM for pure premium is still experimental (in
the early stages of development).
