\title{Set reference group to the group with largest exposure}
\usage{
biggest_reference(x, weight)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A factor (unordered). Character vectors should be converted to
factor before use.}

\item{weight}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x},
typically representing exposure or frequency weights.}
}
\value{
A factor of the same length as \code{x}, with the reference level set
to the group with the largest weight.
}
\description{
Relevels a factor so that the category with the highest total
weight (e.g., exposure) becomes the reference (first) level.
This is useful in regression settings, where the first level of a factor
is taken as the baseline. In insurance applications, the group with the
largest exposure is often chosen as reference.
